# Revive - MERN Stack Project

----------------------------------------------------------------

### Project Description

In a day, our ears come across these statements "I am not feeling myself", "I am not mentally stable", "My mind is filled with so many thoughts", "I am overthinking", "My life is not going the way I want it to", "I am stressed", "I am overwhelmed". 
Having a platform to pour down your thoughts just the way you feel is what helps one organize and clear their mind. This application is focused on decluttering the mind which is piled up with millions of thoughts and helps to bring you back to a stable state.Problems and stress caused by overthinking about those problems is very frequent which again leads to creating a negative and dull vibe to a person. An already known statement, problems always have a solution. Letting out all the thoughts present in the mind gives you a relieved/liberating feeling and also one gets a clear understanding of what they are going through and what 
must be their main focus/priority and then work in an origanized way to keep their thoughts and the mind filled with positivity.
